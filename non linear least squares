# Non linear least squares
# set a seed value

# Generate y as a*e^(bx)+c

# This seems a fairly smooth non-linear plot. To illustrate the difference between linear and nonlinear models, letâ€™s fit them both:
    
#Linear model
    
lin_mod=lm(y~x)

#Plotting the model
plot(x,y)
abline(lin_mod, col = "red")

# There is little overlap between the actual values and the fitted plot. 
# Now letâ€™s try the nonlinear model and specify the formula

nonlin_mod = nls(y~a*exp(b*x),start=list(a=13,b=0.1)) #a is the starting value and b is the exponential start

#This new plot can be made by using the lines() function

plot(x,y)

lines(x,predict(nonlin_mod),col= "blue")

# This is a much better fit and clearly passes through most of the data. For more clarity, we will now calculate the errors for both the models

# Error calculation
error <- lin_mod$residuals  
lm_error <- sqrt(mean(error^2))   #5.960544
error2=y-predict(nonlin_mod)
nlm_error <- sqrt(mean(error2^2)) #1.527064
